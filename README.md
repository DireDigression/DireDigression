- 👋 Hi, I’m @DireDigression!
- 👀 I’m interested in microprocessors and other goal-driven coding. I have experience with Raspberry Pi and am looking to move into Arduino as well. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Raspberry Pi applications; for programming in my personal TiddlyWiki, I'm working on JavaScript (and wikiText).
  - I also do semiconductor material and device fab and characterization, and I'm looking to develop my coding for that as well, particularly in Python.
  - I frequently use LaTeX and MATLAB.
  - I also have a little experience in C++, Mathematica, Assembly, and VHDL.
  - My favorite part of coding is that while I'm not fluent in any one language, I've had enough experience in an array that I can quickly (re)learn enough
      to create functional, if not beautiful, code in whatever language the application requires.
